RSG-Coffin: Wild West Body & Beast Bazaar! ü™¶üê¥üíÄ
RSG-Coffin is a RedM script for running a hilariously grim business in the Wild West‚Äîcollect, store, and sell human and animal corpses in a deployable coffin! Perfect for outlaws with a taste for the macabre and a knack for profit.

Features
Deploy Coffins: Drop a stylish p_coffin01x coffin anywhere to start your creepy collection.
Store Bodies & Beasts: Stash human NPCs and animals (yep, that coyote counts!) in your coffin like a twisted trophy case.
Sell for Cash: Hawk your haul of humans and critters for quick coin at the shadiest market in town.
Pick Up & Skedaddle: Grab your coffin and bolt when the law gets nosy‚Äîno evidence, no jail time!
Slick Interactions: Use ox_target to pick up, store, or sell with a click. ox_lib menus let you choose your coffin in style.
Auto-Cleanup: Coffins vanish when you log off or the resource stops, keeping the West tidy.
How It Works
